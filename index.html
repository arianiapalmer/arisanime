        <h2>Anime Genres</h2>
        <p>
            There are so many different genre of anime, sometimes you have a hard time desribing what it is you're watching.
            According to gamerant the most popular genres in anime are:
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Shonen</strong></dt>
                <dd>Shonen anime and manga are aimed at that demographic. A lot of these anime and manga have a young male hero and are focused on action, adventure, and fighting</dd>
                <dt><strong>Shouju</strong></dt>
                <dd>Shoujo. Shoujo is the opposite of shonen, translated in English as young girl. Shoujo focuses more on the interpersonal relationship and romance in the story rather than the fighting and action. The series tend to be more dramatic, but also still include the adventure, comedy and action that are prevalent in shonen</dd>
                <dt><strong>Slice Of Life</strong></dt>
                <dd>Slice of Life anime is a unique genre in the sense that it focuses on just one moment or day in your favorite lead's life. It gives you all kinds of insights into what they might be feeling and thinking while also giving them an accurate perspective on reality too</dd>
                <dt><strong>Sci-Fi</strong></dt>
                <dd>Sci-fi, or science fiction, is a genre of speculative anime based on imagination. They usually explore a new world, whether in the future or in the past, in addition to other planets and alternative lands.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Adventure</strong></dt>
                <dd>Adventure anime is usually characterized by the characters in the show typically being on some kind of journey, traveling unfamiliar territory and working towards some kind of goal. Adventure anime often features a group of heroes, rather than just one or two protagonists.</dd>
